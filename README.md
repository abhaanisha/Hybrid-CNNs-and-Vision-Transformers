## Abstract
This work presents a hybrid architecture that leverages the strengths of both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance performance on computer vision tasks. Our approach combines the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the global context modeling of Vision Transformers, resulting in improved accuracy and efficiency across various vision benchmarks.

## Key Features
- Hybrid CNN-ViT architecture for computer vision tasks
- Improved performance over standalone CNN or ViT models
- Efficient implementation with reduced computational requirements
- Comprehensive evaluation on standard computer vision benchmarks
